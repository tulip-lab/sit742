    "3. We use the **split()** method to break each line into a list containing all the fields of interest.

To get each data item in a list, we use index with the list. e.g. values[0] will return the item of position 0 in the list.  Note that in Python the position of items in a list is starting from $0$.

For creating a new file used for writing, the same **open()** function is used. Instead using 'r' mode, 'w' mode is used as the parameter. When we open a file for writing, a new, empty file with the specified  name is created and ready to accept our data. \n",
