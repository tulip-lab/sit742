We are going to practice on three control flow statements, i.e., \n**if**, **for** and **while**, to see how they can \ndetermine what statement is to be executed next in a program.  \n\nSecond, we will look at how to create, read, and write files in *Python*. \nWe have  obtained data via interation with users in previous prac. Now let us \nexplore how  to deal with files  to get input of a program and write \noutput that can be used later. \n\n\n\nFinally, we will learn about advanced data types in addition to the **strings** \nand **number** learnt before.  We will examine **lists**, **tuples**\nand **dictionarys** used for a collection of related data. \n",

While function **range()** creates an *iterable*, which can be used to produce  sequence dynamically in *Python 3*; \n\t**range()** in *Python 2* creates a list. The use of  iterable object in \\emph{Python} 3 is more efficient in memory wise. This is especially useful when you need a giganic range.\n\t\n3. As you have noticed,  statement **print(range(5))** in *Python 3* will not produce a list. However,  this statement is valid in *Python 2*.

The *mode* that is specified for the file opening decides what you can do with the file: read, write or both. Then the file object's  **read()** or **write()** method can  be used to read from or write to the file. Finally, when you are finished with the file, you call the **close()** method to tell Python that you are done using the file. \n\nHere is an example. You can download the data file **score.txt**, which includes  data on students' score. The format of the data file is as follows:",

To process all of the data, we use a **for** loop to iterate over the lines of the file. The **line** variable is a string that is used to store characters in each line.\n\t \n     \n3. We use the **split()** method to break each line into a list containing all the fields of interest. We can then take the value corresponding to **name**, **id** and **score** and  print them in the sentence. To get each data item in a list, we use index with the list. e.g. values[0] will return the item of position 0 in the list.  Note that in Python the position of items in a list is starting from $0$.

For creating a new file used for writing, the same **open()** function is used. Instead using 'r' mode, 'w' mode is used as the parameter. When we open a file for writing, a new, empty file with the specified  name is created and ready to accept our data. \n\nAs an example, consider the **score.txt** data again.
