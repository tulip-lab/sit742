    "Due to advances in technologies for data storage, data from various sources is always stored in different formats\n",
    "and file types. Some data formats store data in a way that can be easily handled by a machine, such as CSV, JSON, and XML.\n",
    "Those formats are usually referred to as machine-readable formats.\n",
    "In contrast, some other data formats or file types store data in a way meant to be read by a human \n",
    "using front-end desktop tools.\n",
    "Those formats or file types are often referred to as hard-to-parse formats.\n",

    "and then store the extracted data in formats that can be easily adopted by the downstream data wranngling tasks.\n",
