Summary\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","[XML](https://www.w3.org/XML/), Extensible Markup Language, is a markup language much like HTML.\n","It is a simple and flexible data format that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a way that \n","is both human and machine readable. As a self-descriptive markup language, XML plays an important role in many information systems. It stores data in plain text format, which provides a platform-independent way of storing, transporting, and sharing data. In this chapter we are going to learn how to parse and extract data from XML files with Python.\n","\n","\n","First and foremost, you will need to have some basic understanding about XML.\n","There are a lot of good introductory materials freely available on **<font color='Blue'>Deakin digital library(https://www.deakin.edu.au/library)</font>**. \n","We suggest the following two sections of Chapter 12 in \"**Dive Into Python 3**\":\n","* 12.2 A 5-Minute Crash Course in XML\n","* 12.3 The Structure Of An Atom Feed\n","\n","If you are quite familiar with XML, you can skip the above materials and jump directly into the parsing sections.\n","\n","XML files are not as easy as the CSV or JSON files to preview and understand.\n","The data we are going to parse is the XML version for the \"Melbourne bike share\" dataset downloaded from\n","[data.gov.au](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Transport-Movement/Melbourne-bike-share/tdvh-n9dv).\n","\n","Let's first open the file in your favorite editor to preview it. Note that it is always necessary to inspect the file before we parse it, as the inspection can give an idea of what the format of the file is, what information it stores, etc. If you scroll through the opened file, you will find that the data has been encompassed in XML syntax, using things called tags. The following figure shows a snippet of the data.\n","\n","![XML](https://github.com/tulip-lab/sit742/raw/master/Jupyter/image/xml_example.png \"XML File\")\n","\n","\n","After inspecting the file, you should find that <b>data values</b> can be stored in two places in an XML file, which are:\n","* The first one is in between two tags <font color='green'><featurename\\> and </featurename\\></font>, for example, \n","    ```html\n","        <featurename>Harbour Town - Docklands Dve - Docklands</featurename>\n","    ```\n","    where the value is \"Harbour Town - Docklands Dve - Docklands\" for the <featurename> tag.\n","* The second one is as an attribute of a tag, for example\n","    ```html\n","        <coordinates human_address=\"{&quot;address&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;city&quot;:&quot;&quot;\n","        ,&quot;state&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;zip&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" \n","        latitude=\"-37.814022\" longitude=\"144.939521\" needs_recoding=\"false\"/>\n","    ```\n","    where the value of latitude is -37.814022 and longitude is 144.939521. \n","\n","The attributes in XML store rich information about a specific tag.\n","Comparing XML with JSON, you will find that the XML tags and attributes hold data in \n","a similar way to the JSON keys. \n","The advantage of XML is that each tag in XML can hold more than one attribute, and\n","more values can be stored in one node. See the \"coordinate\" tag above.\n","\n","Now, how can we extract data stored either in between tags or as attributes?\n","The goal is to parse the XML file, extract relevant information, and store the information in Pandas DataFrame that looks like\n","\n","![XML](https://github.com/tulip-lab/sit742/raw/master/Jupyter/image/parsed_xml.png \"XML File\")\n","\n","\n","In the following sections, we will demonstrate the process of loading and exploring a XML file, extracting\n","data from the XML file and storing the data in Pandas DataFrame.\n","* * * "]},{"metadata":{"id":"-vdQTtFnDAho","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 1.
