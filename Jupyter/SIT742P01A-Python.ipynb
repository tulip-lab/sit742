    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are basically three types of cells in a IPython notebook: Code Cells, Markdown Cells, Raw Cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code cells** : Code cell can be used to enter code and will be executed by Python interpreter. Although we will not use other language in this unit, it is good to know that Jupyter Notebooks  also support JavaScript,  HTML, and Bash commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "*** Markdown cells***: You have created markdown cell in the previous section. Markdown Cells are the easiest way to write and format text. It is also give structure to the notebook. Markdown language is used in this type of cell. Follow this link https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics  for the basics of the syntax.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a  Markdown Cells example notebook sourced from : https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/notebook/notebook.html\n",
    "This markdown cheat sheet can also be good reference to the main markdowns you might need to use in our pracs http://nestacms.com/docs/creating-content/markdown-cheat-sheet\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Raw cells** : Raw cells, unlike all other Jupyter Notebook cells, have no input-output distinction. This means that raw Cells cannot be rendered into anything other than what they already are. They are mainly used to create examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have seen, you can use the toolbar to choose between different cell types. In addition, shortcut **M** and **Y** can be used to quickly change a cell to Code cell or Markdown cell under Command mode. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operation modes of Jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edit mode**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Edit mode is used to enter text in cells and to execute code. As you have seen, after typing some code in the notebook and pressing **CTRL+Enter**, the notebook executes the cell and diplays output. The other two shortcuts used to run code in a cell are **Shift +Enter** and **Alt + Enter**. \n",
    "\n",
    "These three ways to run the the code in a cells are summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pressing Shift + Enter: This runs the cell and select the next cell(A new cell is created if at the end of the notebook). This is the most usual way to execute a cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pressing Ctrl + Enter: This runs the cell and keep the same cell selected. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Pressing Alt + Enter: This runs the cell and insert a new cell below it. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Command mode**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Command mode, you can edit the notebook as a whole, but not type into individual cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use keyboard shortcut in this mode to perform the notebook and cell actions efficiently. For example, if you are in command mode and press **c**, you will copy the current cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " There are a large amount of shortcuts available in the command mode. However, you do not have to remember all of them, since most actions in the command mode are available in the menu. \n",
    " \n",
    " Here is a list of the most useful shortcuts. They are arranged by the \n",
    " order we recommend you learn so that you can edit the cells efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Basic navigation: \n",
    "\n",
    "   - Enter: switch to Edit mode\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Esc: switch to Command mode\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Shift+Enter: Execute a cell\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Up, down: Move to the cell above or below\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Cell types: \n",
    "  - y: switch to code cell)\n",
    "  - m: switch to markdown cell) \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cell creation: \n",
    "    - a: insert new sell above\n",
    "    - b: insert new cell  below\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Cell deleting:\n",
    "    - press D twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that one of the most common (and frustrating) mistakes when using the\n",
    "notebook is to type something in the wrong mode. Remember to use **Esc**\n",
    "to switch to the Command mode and **Enter** to switch to the Edit mode.\n",
    "Also, remember that **clicking** on a cell automatically places it in the Edit\n",
    "mode, so it will be necessary to press **Esc** to go to the Command mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\n",
    "Please go ahead and try these shortcuts. For example, try to insert new cell, modify and delete an existing cell. You can also switch cells between code type and markdown type, and practice different kinds of formatting in a markdown cell.\n",
    " \n",
